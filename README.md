WebCV
============

This is a single-page applicating built on FLask and Backbone.

This is used to display a personal resume and eventually have it as a web
portfolio.

All the data including the images are stored in a Heroku Postgres DB, so the
webpage itself can be easily used by anyone else. A .SQL script is included to
create all the tables if needed.
